pluses:
easy to run plex and kodi on
pretty nice hardware
can stream games with sunshine/moonlight

negatives:
hasn't had a hardware refresh in a while?
	nvidia discontinued the game stream thing which makes me wonder what will happen in the future
seems to get dust and slow down after a month requiring resets?
expensive if all you want is streaming

In the end I went for the [[Steam deck]]
