This is a subjective hobby. While there are certain technical aspects about a headphone that are not subject to personal preference (example: how technical the sound is, how wide the sound stage feels, how good is the instrument separation, how wide or narrow it feels, how good the tambor is), there are other aspects which are subjective.

The vocal majority of audiophiles tend to prefer headphones or audio gear that has a crisp detailed sound and has a signature that is in the neighborhood of the Harman curve which is a Frequency Response curve based on many years of research by Harman.

Anything that deviates from that the Harman Curve significantly, is something that audiophiles will usually lift their noses at. That does not, however, mean that the gaming headsets are bad.

Let's look at your headset in particular: [Harman OE 2018 Target, Logitech G Pro X USB - Frequency Responses based on chinese clone of IEC60318-4 made by Filk (squig.link)](https://filk.squig.link/?share=Harman_OE_2018_Target,Logitech_G_Pro_X_USB)  
If you go to that link and compare the Frequency Response measurements of the G Pro X compared ot the Harman curve you will see that there are significant deviations. The sub and mid bass is considerably emphasized. Having an emphasized sub bass doesn't tend to have immensely bad consequences to the overall sound of a headphone though it often comes at the cost of detail in the higher frequencies but having an emphasized mid-bass *somewhere between 60 and 200Hz can lead to the sound becoming muffled and muddied.

This is exacerbated by the midrange response which is God awful on the G Pro X. I have to be honest here. You have a very strong bass that overwhelms other frequencies and mid-range that is considerably recessed and mid-range is typically where most typical percursive instruments and male vocals lie.

There is some forwardness in the upper midrange, between 1.2k and 2k frequencies which means that some higher pitched vocals will sound very lively, and the treble region is generally well behaved.

This is a typical frequency response of a V or perhaps even U shaped headphone which are tuned to have punchy bass and sparkly highs which can lead to more exciting sound though almost always at the cost of detail, a weak mid-range and mediocre technical details.

While gaming you will surely feel the explosions rumbling and gunshots will ring in your ears, but if you were to listen to music with these, it would be a much less enjoyable experience than a well tuned headphone, in my opinion.

Now, that isn't to say that all gaming headsets are bad. If you didn't mind spending a bit more money, the Sennheiser PC38X is an excellent budget gaming headset that offers a clean and balanced sound. It won't feel as thumpy and bassy as the G Pro X, but it is a good audio product that you can use for any purpose: [Frequency Responses based on chinese clone of IEC60318-4 made by Filk (squig.link)](https://filk.squig.link/?share=Sennheiser_PC38x)

Another example of a great gaming headset with good sound, albeit at a cost is the Audeze Maxwell which is what I, and many people would consider to be the "end game" of headsets if you want to get the very best one.

With that said, there is nothing wrong with using a normal headphone for gaming and sticking a boom microphone to it.

I hope this is elucidative and that you understand why most audiophiles dislike the sound of gaming headsets but again, please remember, this is a subjective hobby so just because I tell you I think your headset would sound atrocious for music on my ears, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy or even appreciate what I perceive as technical weak points.

Peace!
