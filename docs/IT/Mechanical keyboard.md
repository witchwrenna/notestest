What I want:

Requirements:
Size: 100%, or TKL with separate numpad
Volume knob
Hotswappable
Must keep super (windows) and control button

Bonus:
Pastel colours
RGB lighting
firmware remapping


Switches - I'm not picky, i gamed on a model M, but quiet is preferable

Most of my experience is with gaming keyboards and the model M

I use linux so incompatible software is useless

Thinking about getting some [[Keycaps]]
