Some person's random opinion:
I'll just throw out some opinions of mine. Can't comment on all manufacturers because I haven't tried them all.

GMK - There's a reason why people still buy them even though QC has gone down and lead times are longest in the hobby's history. The quality is unmatched in terms of Cherry profile keycaps, especially ABS where there's not a lot of competition.

SP - DCS, SA, DSA, DSS... Anything that comes out of Signature Plastics is good. ABS or PBT, whatever profile, just buy it. Quality is up there with GMK, QC and communication is better. Lead times are a little rough right now for SA and DCS but it's not as bad as GMK.

ePBT - Disgustingly overpriced for the quality. Everything is bent, mold quality is meh, TKL base kits tend to cost around $100 in GB which is ridiculous and lead times are getting up there with GMK. Dyesub is good but unfortunately that's as much good as I can point out with them.

CRP - Best modern Cherry profile PBT keycaps IMO. Dyesub is crisp, delivery times are reasonable (around a year for the last GB which was the biggest so far), pricing is fair and spacebars/mods are usually straight (latest round). All of my CRP bars are straighter than my GMK bars which is both funny and sad.

Xiami/XMI/21kb - They were great back when they were $25, they're okay at $65. Dyesub is pretty good, kitting is very extensive (apart from ISO layout support) and there's a lot of variety.

Shenpo - v2 Xiami molds (very thick) and okay dyesub. Probably the best value keycaps out there right now at $25-35 depending on where you buy.

IFK - Whenever I hear about them, I only hear about bad quality and color matching. Probably best to avoid.

KAT/KAM - Anything coming out of Keyreative should be avoided at all costs.
