While there are certain technical aspects about a headphone that are not subject to personal preference (example: how technical the sound is, how wide the sound stage feels, how good is the instrument separation, how wide or narrow it feels, how good the tambor is), there are other aspects which are subjective.</p> <p>The vocal majority of audiophiles tend to prefer headphones or audio gear that has a crisp detailed sound and has a signature that is in the neighborhood of the Harman curve which is a Frequency Response curve based on many years of research by Harman.</p> <p>Anything that deviates from that the Harman Curve significantly, is something that audiophiles will usually lift their noses at. That does not, however, mean that the gaming headsets are bad.</p> <p>Let's look at your headset in particular: Harman OE 2018 Target, Logitech G Pro X USB - Frequency Responses based on chinese clone of IEC60318-4 made by Filk (squig.link) If you go to that link and compare the Frequency Response measurements of the G Pro X compared ot the Harman curve you will see that there are significant deviations. The sub and mid bass is considerably emphasized. Having an emphasized sub bass doesn't tend to have immensely bad consequences to the overall sound of a headphone though it often comes at the cost of detail in the higher frequencies but having an emphasized mid-bass *somewhere between 60 and 200Hz can lead to the sound becoming muffled and muddied.</p> <p>This is exacerbated by the midrange response which is God awful on the G Pro X. I have to be honest here. You have a very strong bass that overwhelms other frequencies and mid-range that is considerably recessed and mid-range is typically where most typical percursive instruments and male vocals lie.</p> <p>There is some forwardness in the upper midrange, between 1.2k and 2k frequencies which means that some higher pitched vocals will sound very lively, and the treble region is generally well behaved.</p> <p>This is a typical frequency response of a V or perhaps even U shaped headphone which are tuned to have punchy bass and sparkly highs which can lead to more exciting sound though almost always at the cost of detail, a weak mid-range and mediocre technical details.</p> <p>While gaming you will surely feel the explosions rumbling and gunshots will ring in your ears, but if you were to listen to music with these, it would be a much less enjoyable experience than a well tuned headphone, in my opinion.</p> <p>Now, that isn't to say that all gaming headsets are bad. If you didn't mind spending a bit more money, the Sennheiser PC38X is an excellent budget gaming headset that offers a clean and balanced sound. It won't feel as thumpy and bassy as the G Pro X, but it is a good audio product that you can use for any purpose: Frequency Responses based on chinese clone of IEC60318-4 made by Filk (squig.link)</p> <p>Another example of a great gaming headset with good sound, albeit at a cost is the Audeze Maxwell which is what I, and many people would consider to be the \"end game\" of headsets if you want to get the very best one.</p> <p>With that said, there is nothing wrong with using a normal headphone for gaming and sticking a boom microphone to it.</p> <p>I hope this is elucidative and that you understand why most audiophiles dislike the sound of gaming headsets but again, please remember, this is a subjective hobby so just because I tell you I think your headset would sound atrocious for music on my ears, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy or even appreciate what I perceive as technical weak points.</p> <p>Peace!</p>"},{"location":"IT/Home%20Setup/","title":"Home Setup","text":"<p>The two main components of my home setup are the NAS and Desktop Computer side by side.

Can't comment on all manufacturers because I haven't tried them all.</p> <p>GMK - There's a reason why people still buy them even though QC has gone down and lead times are longest in the hobby's history. The quality is unmatched in terms of Cherry profile keycaps, especially ABS where there's not a lot of competition.</p> <p>SP - DCS, SA, DSA, DSS... Anything that comes out of Signature Plastics is good. ABS or PBT, whatever profile, just buy it. Quality is up there with GMK, QC and communication is better. Lead times are a little rough right now for SA and DCS but it's not as bad as GMK.</p> <p>ePBT - Disgustingly overpriced for the quality. Everything is bent, mold quality is meh, TKL base kits tend to cost around $100 in GB which is ridiculous and lead times are getting up there with GMK. Dyesub is good but unfortunately that's as much good as I can point out with them.</p> <p>CRP - Best modern Cherry profile PBT keycaps IMO. Dyesub is crisp, delivery times are reasonable (around a year for the last GB which was the biggest so far), pricing is fair and spacebars/mods are usually straight (latest round). All of my CRP bars are straighter than my GMK bars which is both funny and sad.</p> <p>Xiami/XMI/21kb - They were great back when they were $25, they're okay at $65. Dyesub is pretty good, kitting is very extensive (apart from ISO layout support) and there's a lot of variety.</p> <p>Shenpo - v2 Xiami molds (very thick) and okay dyesub. Probably the best value keycaps out there right now at $25-35 depending on where you buy.</p> <p>IFK - Whenever I hear about them, I only hear about bad quality and color matching. Probably best to avoid.</p> <p>KAT/KAM - Anything coming out of Keyreative should be avoided at all costs.</p> <p>Thinking of the following: https://www.ashkeebs.com/product/gmk-lavender-keycaps/ ![[Pasted image 20240802211517.png]]</p> <p>https://mintlodica.com/products/dsa-dark-magic-girl-keycaps ![[Pasted image 20240802211509.png]]</p> <p>https://mintlodica.com/products/dsa-witch-girl-keycaps ![[Pasted image 20240802214608.png]]</p> <p>https://mintlodica.com/products/dsa-magic-girl-keycaps?variant=42858693296286 ![[Pasted image 20240802214630.png]]</p> <p>https://spkeyboards.com/collections/kawaii/products/dsa-hana-248-pcs-keyset-double-shot ![[Pasted image 20240802214727.png]]</p> <p>https://novelkeys.com/collections/keycaps/products/kam-lil-dragon ![[Pasted image 20240802220823.png]]</p> <p>https://cannonkeys.com/products/cannoncaps-hydrangea ![[Pasted image 20240802220857.png]]</p> <p>https://cannonkeys.com/products/nicepbt-elderberry ![[Pasted image 20240802220940.png]]</p> <p>https://cannonkeys.com/products/nicepbt-noel?variant=41071476834415 ![[Pasted image 20240802220959.png]]</p> <p>https://cannonkeys.com/products/nicepbt-galaxy ![[Pasted image 20240802221013.png]]</p> <p>https://cannonkeys.com/products/nicepbt-purple-chonkers ![[Pasted image 20240802221033.png]]</p>"},{"location":"IT/Mechanical%20keyboard/","title":"Mechanical keyboard","text":"<p>What I want:</p> <p>Requirements: Size: 100%, or TKL with separate numpad Volume knob Hotswappable Must keep super (windows) and control button</p> <p>Bonus: Pastel colours RGB lighting firmware remapping</p> <p>Switches - I'm not picky, i gamed on a model M, but quiet is preferable</p> <p>Most of my experience is with gaming keyboards and the model M</p> <p>I use linux so incompatible software is useless</p> <p>Thinking about getting some Keycaps</p>"},{"location":"IT/Media%20organization/","title":"Media organization","text":"<p>NAS Currently hosts media using these instances.</p> <p>Trash guides Sonarr Plex radarr</p> <p>https://trash-guides.info/</p> <p>Hosts a jellyfin instance which is accessed through the steamdeck with kodi.</p>"},{"location":"IT/NAS/","title":"NAS","text":"<p>Relevant pages: PSUs Rackmount cases Media organization</p> <p>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/</p> <p>https://ansible-nas.io/</p> <p>Configurations to remember: 45drives  - file share - identity - file browser</p> <p>Possible software to run https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/10ecxfe/what_are_your_top_self_hosted_services_that_you/</p> <p>Porn management system: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/10btdv0/need_a_porn_management_system_pms/</p> <p>https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/13bk0vt/selfhosted_hentai_media_management_arr/ https://github.com/rr-/szurubooru</p> <p>Recipes: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/18wy55c/introducing_recipya_the_clean_recipe_manager/</p> <p>pihole</p> <p>set up quartz4?
